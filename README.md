# HCP-Front-end
Curriculum: Database Management 2020 Spring </br>

In this course, we're assigned the final project to create an website.</br>

We chosen to create an website for our club, HCP.</br>

HCP is an acronym for "Happiness Color Programming".</br>

Why we took this name ? visit "About" page in our club website.</br>

Note: This repo recorded the page I wrote, not all page.
